A day trader can have a majority of winning trades, yet still lose money at the end of the day if their commissions outweigh their profits. Since day traders are continually buying and selling assets, they may rack up substantial costs in the form of trading commissions.<br/><br/>Similarly, optimal execution of orders is essential. Getting in and out of the market and taking small profits continually throughout the day requires efficient order execution. During fast-moving market conditions, such as at the market open or just after an important piece of news has been released, itï¿½s especially important to be working with a broker that can provide reliable order execution."
